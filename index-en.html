        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Nicodemo. I build websites. From scratch or by improving an existing one.
          <br>I've been working in <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> since 2007 but I also switch to different industries because <strong>I love learning</strong> and <strong>challenge myself</strong>. That's why I always "catch the opportunity". I worked (still, for seasonal jobs) as chef, sport crew member and cycling tourist guide.
          <br>Working in the to improve your skills and learn new things every day. That's what developing and maintaining websites is so exciting to me!

            <h3>Web development</h3>
            <p>A website is the way a business, person, brand present nowadays to the world. Often the website is accessed from a mobile device. That's why is important that the pages are responsive and showcase the best content. My approach is to meet the client, understand his/her needs and propose the layout with the best price/quality option.
            </p>
            <p>Prices: it depends. A small presentation site with 4-5 pages (ideal for small business, personal portfolio, like this website) about $100 per page. A larger website that require a database, blog, content media from $800 up to $3000. <a href="#contacts">Write me</a> for a quote then we can talk about it.</p>

          <div class="service">
            <h3>Web maintenance</h3>
            <p>Websites are "live animals" that evolve overtime. With fast technology changes they often need maintenace in order to upgrade the appearance and the content. To reach this goal I can redisign an existing website to give a more modern and good looking appearance. Also update the content and setup your social media accounts.
              <br>Prices: $50/hour • $300/month
            </p>

            <h3>Video promo</h3>
            <p>In the last years I've been passioned about filmaking. I love to create promo videos that tell the story of people, their work and the quality they can offer to a potential customer.
              <br>Prices: $200/photo service (min 15 images) • $500 1'-3' video promo

            Nadia is an artist and textile designer. I had the opportunity to work with her side-by-side during the restyling of her website. Artists are very demanding. :) But she was very happy about the final result.
